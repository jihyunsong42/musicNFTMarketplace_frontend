This DApp(Decentralised Application) is Music NFT(Non-Fungible Token) Marketplace, where customers can mint, buy and sell their music NFTs.<br>In this DApp, user can upload their soundtrack on IPFS(Inter-Planetery File System). After the soundtrack is uploaded, it will return a CID(hash value) in which every NFT should contain. In this project, I used Multi-Token Standard(ERC-1155) so creators can determine how many NFTs they want to mint.<br>Once NFTs are minted, The creator can also upload their music NFTs on tradeblock. Anyone in this blockchain network(in my project, it is running on polygon testnet.) can trade this dApp's user's NFTs via smart contract.<br>This project was conducted with junior UI/UX Designer during Ethereum Hackathon. I took part of front-end and back-end logic on this project and also contributed to the smart contract.

#2 After this page shows up, fill out your song information(soundtrack to upload, cover, title etc.) and click "Mint NFT" button.<br>
#3 We need to upload metadata to IPFS in order to mint NFT(in decentralized way). So pin IPFS Data such as soundtrack and images, I used Pinata API, which is IPFS pinning service. Instead of running my own IPFS node, It helps pinning data <br>
#4 The main page shows KOSPI stock chart, and if you select other market tabs, the chart changes.<br>
#5 You can scale in/out stock charts by clicking time units.

â€» Currently client/server communication is not stable so minting NFT is not working. I am working on this at the moment.<br>
